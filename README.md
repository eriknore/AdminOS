# layared - tool for buildning an OS from layeres
Inspired by docker/silverblue/darch and a few others, i.e. union filesystems and stateless Linux. I want to test the idea of building a Linux OS from layers of squashed filesystems - and of course learning some on the way. I like the idea of building the OS bottom up, but also to be able to reset the OS, or rebuild an exact copy, or boot into different flavors of an OS (e.g. devel, gaming, leisure), etc. Should be distro independant.

Not sure how this will work, performance, updating of OS, and so on? But I see use for this where I work with network security and offline environments. With this I can build a stateless Linux with a persistent home partition, prepackage it with useful tools, just update a few custom applications and providing full OS updates if necessary.

Stay tuned...
